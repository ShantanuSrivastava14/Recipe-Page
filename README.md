## Project Overview

The recipe page is structured using HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, images, ordered lists, and tables to provide a detailed narrative of the Shami Kebab recipe. Here are the main sections of the code:

- A brief narrative sets the stage for the culinary journey, inviting readers to join in on the adventure.

### The Chickpea Chronicles

- This section narrates the process of soaking and cooking black chickpeas, divided into two acts: The Soaking Saga and The Pressure Cooker Quest.
- Each act is presented as an ordered list (`<ol>`), with descriptive steps and accompanying images.

### The Mixture Mission

- The section focuses on preparing the mixture for Shami Kebab, divided into two acts: The Mash-Up and The Flavor Fling.
- Similar to the previous section, each act is presented as an ordered list with detailed steps.

### The Shaping and Frying Fable

- This section details the final steps of shaping and frying the kebabs, divided into two acts: Shaping Shenanigans and Frying Frolics.
- Descriptive steps guide the reader through the shaping and frying process, with accompanying images.
